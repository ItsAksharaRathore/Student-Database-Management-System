### Project Structure
The Student Database Management System is organized into several key files and directories:

- **main.cpp**: The entry point of the application.
- **student.h / student.cpp**: Contains the `Student` class definition and implementation.
- **course.h / course.cpp**: Contains the `Course` class definition and implementation.
- **semester.h / semester.cpp**: Contains the `Semester` class definition and implementation.
- **utils.h / utils.cpp**: Utility functions and helpers.

### Class Descriptions

### Data Storage
Data is stored in memory using standard C++ containers such as `vector`. Each student and course is represented as an object, and their details are stored as attributes within these objects.

### Mark Calculation
Marks for each course are entered and updated using dedicated methods in the `Course` class. The total marks for a course are calculated by summing the marks for all assessments. The `getCourseGrade` method computes the grade based on the total marks.

The `Student` class calculates the CGPA by averaging the grades of all courses a student is enrolled in.

### Error Handling
The application includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and operations. This ensures the system remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users.

### Future Enhancements
- **Database Integration**: Integrate with a database to store and retrieve data persistently.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web-based interface for remote access and management.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Add more customizable reporting features.
